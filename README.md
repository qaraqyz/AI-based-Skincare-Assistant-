1. Summary Statement
It is necessary to maintain healthy skin since that plays a crucial role in controlling face condition and safeguarding it. Skincare field has a massive production of various products that are not suitable for everyone, not to mention the fact that skin is difficult to analyze. This lack of direction can result in frustrating skin care procedures, unnecessary harm to sensitive skin, money spent on useless products, and frustration.
This document suggests an AI-based skincare assistant that analyzes facial issues and creates customized skincare routines recommending appropriate products based on skin type. This project used a deep learning algorithm-based facial skin image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) deep learning algorithm, and it can recognize four classes of facial skin problems, acne, blackhead, carcinoma, wrinkles, and normal skin condition. Finally, by understanding and classifying the issue, the assistant offers skin treatment according to skin type. 
2. Results and Outcomes of the Project
The project successfully led to the development of a user-friendly, AI-powered skincare assistant that:
● Analyzes user skin types and concerns through a combination of questionnaires and image analysis.
● Offers tailored skincare advice, including product recommendations and routine suggestions.
● Educating users about skin care through an interactive, AI-driven interface.
● Integrates with e-commerce platforms for direct purchase suggestions.
The platform demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in skin analysis and user satisfaction, with a significant percentage of users reporting improved skin health and a better understanding of skincare.
